                A project exploring the mathematical and statistical side of disease modelling 
                (as my dissertation focussed on the use of deep learning methods).
                It combined the skills and experience gained in modules: Statistical Pattern 
                Recognition, Mathematical Modelling: Computational Methods
                and Mathematical Ecology, Epidemiology & Evolution. 
                <br><br>
                I found that Bayesian modelling can enable a strong idea of how a disease
                may spread through a population, with much less data and computational power
                than deep learning methods.

            <div class="project-description">My undergraduate dissertation project, 
                for BSc Mathematics. This project entailed original research into
                the deep learning architectures LSTMs (long-short term memory) and
                GCNs (graph convolutional networks) in time-series forecasting. It
                won the 'Best Novel Programming Project' Prize in 2025 from the
                University of York and the Leeds-based medical software company, TPP.
                <br><br>
                I found that the most effective deep learning models were the LSTMs,
                however, my work suggests that statistical methods such as ARIMA
                are still the gold-standard for time-series prediciton.

                whereby the RSNA (Radiological Society of North America) 
                curated the largest public dataset consisting of around 2,000 
                patients, with more than 100,000 slices of MRI scans.
                <br><br>
                A U-Net was trained to predict whether the patient has lumbar 
                degeneration as well as the level of severity of said condition 
                (normal/mild/severe). The RSNA provides a dataset of 1,975 
                patients of 35+ MRI scans.
                <br><br>
                My U-Net, trained from scratch, achieved roughly 66%
                accuracy on the evaluation set, which is a 60% increase on 
                approaches with a pre-trained CNN, such as a ResNet.

            <div class="project-description">A data science project completed in the 
                module 'Becoming a Bioscientist IV: Research in Action' at the University
                of York. This project persued the question "Is there a correlation 
                between the receding tree line* and the microbes found there?". 
                <br><br>
                Results showed that there were some data which 
                pointed toward specific bacterial communities contributing to 
                the growth of young saplings. There are grounds for further 
                study into this theory of the relationship between the tree line 
                and the temperature, precipitation and the microbes found there.
                <br><br>
                A technique I envisioned being useful was the use of a knowledge 
                graph (figure 1), as the sites' coordinates are representative of
                their precipitation and temperature. This graph effectively communicates
                how sites and the micro-organisms are related to one another.
                <br><br>
                To achieve the level of detail and control I wanted, I created
                a custom R package 'py2RNetworkX', which ported the Python package
                NetworkX to R. <a href="https://github.com/JIC1444/py2RNetworkX">py2RNetworkX Repo</a>
