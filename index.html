                My name is Jake Cordery, I find machine learning and all things related
                equally fascinating and baffling - I have done alot of different research and 
                engineering projects within the deep learning space in order to gain a 
                general overview of the most prominent methods in computer vision, time-series
                forecasting, language processing, etc. At the moment I am looking to do a PhD 
                in deep learning, applied to the field of disease/medicine. To me, this is 
                the ultimate use of AI - to change people's lives and even lifespans. 
                The detection and prevention of life-altering or life-threatening diseases is the 
                area I want to dedicate myself to.
                <br><br>
                On top of this, I am starting my own company - Pioneer.AI, 
                offering private LLM services to small to medium companies who do not 
                have in-house GPUs and require that company data is never used for training.
                The scope of responsibilities that founding a company brings has been a great
                learning experience, and has intoduced me to many new skills within DevOps,
                legal, marketing and buisness as a whole.
                <br><br>
                I have a 1st class degree in BSc (Hons) Mathematics from the University of 
                York (2022-2025), winning the best programming project prize for my dissertation, 
                and being runner up for best overall prize (highest mark). Currently, I am 
                completing my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at St. Andrews University.
                <br><br>
                Below is a summary of many of the projects I have completed in the realm of machine
                learning, data science and data analytics. The projects are in chronological
                order.

            <div class="project-description">
                A project exploring the mathematical and statistical side of disease modelling 
                (as my dissertation focussed on the use of deep learning methods).
                It combined the skills and experience gained in many of my final year modules 
                at York, and tested the advantages of the Julia programming language, including
                the packages Turing.jl and DifferentialEquations.jl.
                <br><br>
                I found that Bayesian modelling enables a strong idea of how a disease
                may spread through a population, with much less data and computational power
                than deep learning methods.
                <br><br>
                Thank you to Dr. Gustav Delius (University of York) for offering supervisory 
                comments in order to improve the results of this project.

            <div class="project-description">My undergraduate dissertation project, 
                for BSc Mathematics. This project entailed original research into
                the deep learning architectures LSTMs (long-short term memory) and
                GCNs (graph convolutional networks) in time-series forecasting. It
                won the 'Best Novel Programming Project' Prize in 2025 from the
                University of York and the Leeds-based medical software company, TPP.
                <br><br>
                I found that the most effective deep learning models were the LSTMs,
                however, my work suggests that statistical methods such as ARIMA
                are still the gold-standard for time-series prediciton.

            </div>
            <div class="project-description">A research project with the Director of 
                Mathematical Sciences at York - Mitya Pushkin. The project 
                is a start toward the greater goal of developing a diffusion model 
                to generate novel collagen sequences. To make this possible, however,
                there needs to exist a reliable in silico method of testing whether 
                these novel sequences of collagen have a realistic set of properties.
                <br><br>
                This is the reasoning behind my implementation of Markus J. Buehler's
                paper 'CollagenTransformer: End-to-End Transformer Model to Predict 
                Thermal Stability of Collagen Triple Helices Using an NLP Approach'. 
                The paper being a fe years old meant that the Python Notebook on the 
                github repo for the paper was no longer working
                and returned inaccurate values. So firstly, a lot of time was spent in 
                finding the correct package versions by trial and error. 
                Then, the CollagenTransformer was tested on data from the department, 
                to ensure that the model was accurate (illustrated below).
                <br><br>
                Then, a literature review was conducted in the realm of de novo generation
                of protein and collagen sequences. Overall, this determined that currently,
                while de novo generation of proteins (not including collagens) is a promising
                direction, there is currently not enough data on the sequences of collagen
                to train a reliable model.

                <br><br>
                A U-Net was trained to predict whether the patient has lumbar 
                degeneration as well as the level of severity of said condition 
                (normal/mild/severe). The RSNA provides a dataset of 1,975 
                patients of 35+ MRI scans.
                <br><br>
                My U-Net, trained from scratch, achieved roughly 66%
                accuracy on the evaluation set, which is a 60% increase on 
                approaches with a pre-trained CNN, such as a ResNet.

                module 'Becoming a Bioscientist IV: Research in Action' at the University
                of York. This project persued the question "Is there a correlation 
                between the receding tree line* and the microbes found there?". 
                <br><br>
                Results showed that there were some data which 
                pointed toward specific bacterial communities contributing to 
                the growth of young saplings. There are grounds for further 
                study into this theory of the relationship between the tree line 
                and the temperature, precipitation and the microbes found there.
                <br><br>
                A technique I envisioned being useful was the use of a knowledge 
                graph (figure 1), as the sites' coordinates are representative of
                their precipitation and temperature. This graph effectively communicates
                how sites and the micro-organisms are related to one another.
                <br><br>
                To achieve the level of detail and control I wanted, I created
                a custom R package 'py2RNetworkX', which ported the Python package
                NetworkX to R. <a href="https://github.com/JIC1444/py2RNetworkX">py2RNetworkX Repo</a>
